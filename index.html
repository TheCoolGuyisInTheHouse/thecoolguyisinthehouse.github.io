<img src="https://nahoo.net/images/screens/Dune2-Harkonnen-Starport.jpg" id="starport_img" class="center" />
<p>&tab;Dune II: The Building of a Dynasty was a wildly successful game by Westwood studios, based on the Dune franchise started by Frank Herbert.  However, the game had a major part of it deleted from one of its source files, namely scenario.pak.  As such, the game would operate as intended, but the deletion of that data resulted in the “ ‘Thopter” not rendering in the game, making it inaccessible from the in-game starport.  In order to correct the error you are going to have to use a hex (hexadecimal) editor to add in the missing byte, which is a missing apostrophe.  There are a lot of free online hex editors (like <a href="https://hexed.it">HexEd.it</a>), so you shouldn’t want for a way to access one.  A hex editor basically takes a file, reads the raw binary, and then converts it into binary, hexadecimal (1 or 2 bytes at a time) and/or into plaintext.</p>
